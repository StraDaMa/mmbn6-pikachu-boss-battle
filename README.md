Introduction:
-------------
This mod implements a Pikachu boss fight and Battle Chip in *Mega Man Battle Network 6 Cybeast Falzar*. This boss fight can be found as a free-fight in Lan's Room. Pikachu replaces the removed boss "Count" and an unused chip.

Compiling:
-------------
Compiling the source requires a **US** copy of *Mega Man Battle Network 6 Cybeast Falzar*. The ROM should be renamed `input.gba` and put in the base directory. To compile, use the versions of *TextPet* and *PixelPet* included.
After the ROM is renamed and added to the base directory, run `compile.bat`
